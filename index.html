            and get the product at doorstep. only the frontend devlopment had completed. i created It

            <p>i had created 2nd project as login page. it was very cool.i had added some animations to it.<br>
                A login page is a gateway to secure online platforms. Users input credentials—typically username<br>
                and password—to access personalized accounts or services. It ensures privacy, data protection,<br>
                and user authentication. Modern login pages often incorporate security features like two-factor<br>
                authentication to enhance protection against unauthorized access. </p>
